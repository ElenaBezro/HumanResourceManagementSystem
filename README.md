The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an efficient Human Resource Management System (HRMS) that facilitates the job application and recruitment processes. The system aims to streamline interactions between applicants, job positions, and recruiters. By integrating functionalities such as tracking previous companies, preferred locations, expected salary of applicants, and managing job positions with varying salary ranges and required skills, the HRMS seeks to automate and optimize the recruitment workflow.
The project places a strong emphasis on clean, well-organized, and efficient code, ensuring that the implemented classes and methods align with best practices. Through careful design considerations and comprehensive unit testing, the project aims to deliver a robust and reliable solution.
